This is online test for Sofware Engineer (Mobile Web / Frontend Web) at Tokopedia

I use [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for this test because Next.js has cool features such as Server-rendered, Automatic code splitting, Hot Module Replacement and Customizable my own Babel and Webpack configurations.
